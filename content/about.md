A geek, avid learner, and tinkerer with a deep passion for databases, operating systems, compilers, low-level programming, and Linux. I’m constantly exploring the intricacies of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and the vibrant world of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). With a focus on high-performance, memory-efficient applications and a love for understanding how things work under the hood, I strive to push the boundaries of modern computing. Whether it's optimizing systems at a low level or contributing to the open-source community, I’m always learning, building, and sharing knowledge.
